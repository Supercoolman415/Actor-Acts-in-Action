<p><a href="http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/99501/how-is-the-actor-model-used"> Human-computer interaction, and computer-supported collaborative work, the series aims to bring together and mutually inform conceptual developments and empirical explorations of the technological mediation of human activity in these and other fields such as sociology, communication, education, and organizational studies.</p>
<br>
<p>Acting With Technology volumes encompass a diversity of theoretical frameworks including activity theory, actor network theory, distributed cognition, and other practice-based theories developed through ethnomethodological and grounded theory approaches.</p>
<br>
<p> Actors can live on a single thread, allowing unthread-safe/non-concurrent operations to happen without a bunch of locking magic. An action will respond to messages in it's inbox. When you want it to process a command you send it a message and it will take care of them in the order they are received. Just like a normal queue. Thread safe is killer here, and I use this in a number of open source projects I work on.</p>
